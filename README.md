## Introduction  
Capbox mission is to make developers life easier by bringing more automation to the Capacitor apps building worflow. With it, you can drop the native tools and have more time to focus on the core of your application business - or to spend with your family and friends, watch your favourite show... Who knows? ;).

#### Configuring the distribution:  
* Create an account on [Microsoft App Center](https://appcenter.ms/apps)  
* [Configure your application on the dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/dashboard/)  
* Pro tip: Create multiple stages for your application.  
* Add the following settings to the root of your `capacitor.config.json file`:  
```
  "publish": {
    "appcenter": {
      "organization": "App Center Org.",
      "ios": {
        "development": "App Center Org./MyApp-iOS-Development",
        "homolog": "App Center Org./MyApp-iOS-Homolog",
        "production": "App Center Org./MyApp-iOS"
      },
      "android": {
        "development": "App Center Org./MyApp-Android-Development",
        "homolog": "App Center Org./MyApp-Android-Homolog",
        "production": "App Center Org./MyApp-Android"
      }
    }
  }
```  
  
##### Configuring custom stages  
* In case you need custom stages, just add them to the `capacitor.config.json`, like:  
```
  "publish": {
    "appcenter": {
      "organization": "App Center Org.",
      "ios": {
        "QA": "App Center Org./MyApp-iOS-QA"
      },
      "android": {
        "QA": "App Center Org./MyApp-Android-QA"
      }
    }
  }
```  
* Then use them as the stage parameter:  
`$ capbox distribute android --stage=QA`
